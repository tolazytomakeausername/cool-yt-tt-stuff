Heyyyy!!! Wazzzupp!!! First non ai generated readme! (mostly cause it was doing a bs job for this one)
So, yeah, yt downloader!
Dependencies:::: 
yt-dlp
google-api-python-client
python-dotenv
ffmpeg
Python 3.6 or higher
isodate
do pip install yt-dlp google-api-python-client python-dotenv isodate 
Install ffmpeg with sudo apt install ffmpeg for debian, or brew install ffmpeg for macOS
For windows, idfk gfy
What ts does is lets you download any yt video or playlist from youtube as audio, or audio and video!!! Cool, right? Oh, it's not cool? FUCK OF-
Anyways, whatchu wanna do first is go to the latest download and down load the one called "yt" 
Now that you have that, you gonna go to wherever it is, and then if you're on linux debian, do "chmod +x yt" And no output = shouldve worked
Then,You need to do "pip install google_api_python_client dotenv yt-dlp ffmpeg. 
You gotta go to "https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com?authuser=1&inv=1&invt=Ab08Sg&supportedpurview=project" and click enable, then go to "credentials" and then click "create credentials" click "API key" click generate. Copy the API key and then go to where you put yt file and then create a new file called .env 
Now you want to go into the .env, then type "YOUTUBE_API_KEY=12345678910111213" (Replace with your actual API key) 
IMPORTANT!!! DO NOT SHARE API KEY WITH ANYONE!!!!! THIS CAN BE USED TO IMPERSONATE YOU AND CAUSE FRAUD. DO NOT SHARE!!!!!!!
Anyways... Now, you want to do yt -h. If shit pops up, you chillin. If shit doesn't popup, you not.
Anyways, what this shit does is let you download most tt videos and all youtube videos + playlists
